Chime is an experimental playground for learning 3D graphics techniques.

Areas to build out include:
 - Implemented in C#
 - Graphics are D3D11 via SharpDX
 - VR headset & motion controller support via OpenVR
 - Mouse, Keyboard, and Gamepad input via RawInput
 - Procedural physical sky shader
 - Physical cloud shader
 - Real-time physics-driven windchime simulation with procedural audio
